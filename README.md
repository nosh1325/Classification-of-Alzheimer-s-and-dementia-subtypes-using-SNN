# Classification-of-Alzheimer-s-and-dementia-subtypes-using-SNN
This research presents a biologically inspired approach to Alzheimer’s disease classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained without backpropagation. The proposed model employs Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with Poisson spike encoding of 64×64 grayscale MRI scans across four disease stages. Three fully connected SNN layers are trained using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and the Forward-Forward learning paradigm, emphasizing local learning through goodness-based weight updates and homeostatic regulation. The model incorporates time-varying ultra-sparse spike encoding and contrastive learning with positive and negative samples to enhance separability. Evaluations include performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices. Results demonstrate that SNNs can effectively distinguish Alzheimer’s stages without gradient-based optimization, providing a biologically inspired alternative for neurodegenerative disease classification.
